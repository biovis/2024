# Bio+MedVis Challenge @ IEEE VIS 2024

This year’s challenge is currently in preparation but will be released soon. To
get an idea about the complexity of the challenge, please have a look at the
[challenge from 2023](http://biovis.net/2023/biovisChallenges_vis/) in the
meantime.

## Program

The Bio+MedVis Challenge, jointly organized by the [BioVis](http://biovis.net/2024/)
and [VCBM](https://conferences.eg.org/vcbm2024/) communities,
will be organized as a half-day event within the IEEE VIS 2024 conference. The
program will consist of invited talks, presentations of accepted submissions,
and other supplementary sessions. Details will follow soon.

## Submission

Submissions will be considered for talk and/or poster presentations. You will be
requested to submit a two-page PDF abstract with unlimited additional figures
and a draft of your proposed poster (max 10MB) to the PCS. The deadlines will be
announced soon.

Selected submissions will be invited for talk presentations during the
Bio+MedVis Challenge session at the [IEEE VIS
