## Redesign Challenge: Redesign an Existing Visualization

### Biological Background and Data Description

In biology, structure and function are tightly linked, and the biology
of cells in tissues is no exception. A key challenge for cell biologists
lies in understanding the spatial patterns characteristic of health and
disease. While historical single-cell profiling techniques have required
tissue dissociation, a cutting-edge area of cell biology research is the
development and application of technologies that measure molecular
states within cells while preserving the spatial context that is
critical to establishing a localized picture of tissue health.

A key cellular measurement technique is called transcriptomics, which
provides insight into cell types (e.g., immune cell vs. muscle cell),
cell states (e.g., response to stimuli), and information about proteins
that might be produced downstream (i.e., via translation).
Transcriptomics techniques acquire this information by measuring gene
expression: the abundance of RNA transcripts corresponding to each gene
in each cell. As the name implies, _spatial_ transcriptomics methods
capture gene expression and spatial coordinates simultaneously.
Resolutions of spatial transcriptomics methods can vary from
subcellular, to single-cell, to "spots" that represent multiple cells.
There is typically a tradeoff between the spatial resolution and the
number of genes that can be measured by a given technology.

**VISIUM** is a spatial transcriptomics technology developed by 10x
Genomics. It allows researchers to measure gene expression and spatial
organization of tissues simultaneously. For a given tissue slice, VISIUM
is able to measure transcripts genome-wide (e.g., \~20,000 genes for
human samples) at a resolution of approximately 5-10 cells per spot.
This enables researchers to understand how gene expression patterns vary
across different regions of a tissue sample. This technology has
applications in various fields such as cancer research, developmental
biology, neuroscience, and more, allowing researchers to gain deeper
insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex biological
processes within tissues.

While each VISIUM spot represents the gene expression of multiple cells,
researchers are typically interested in interpreting the data at the
cell type level (e.g., linking expression differences to particular cell
types that are characterized in the biological literature). As a result,
computational methods have been developed to deconvolute each VISIUM
spot into a distribution of (predicted) cell-type proportions.
Biologists can then use the deconvolution results to link their findings
to their existing cell type knowledge.

These deconvolutional methods thus produce data that, on a per-spot
basis, represents proportional cell-type membership (e.g. 30% Cell Type
1, 50% Cell Type 2, 20% Cell Type 3). Visualizing these data in the
context of the H&E stained tissue image provides crucial spatial
context, enabling domain experts to explore deconvolution results within
the intricate cellular architecture and tissue morphology. One common
technique for visualizing these data is to superimpose a pie chart on
each spot location representing the cell types represented. Pie charts
and their limitations have been well explored by the visualization
community. Moreover, superimposing them on the image occludes the
underlying tissue and prevents important contextual inspection of a
given spot.

### Redesign Challenge Task

For this redesign task, we challenge participants to propose an
alternative visualization approach that links the spot cell-type
proportion to the H&E image. Submissions should consider visualization
theory and principles.

Sketching and prototyping as well as fully interactive solutions will be
accepted. Creativity and novelty will be considered in the evaluation.

## 3D Microscopy Imaging Challenge: From a RAW imaging volume to biological findings

### Biological Background and Data Description

Highly multiplexed tissue imaging methods, such as Cyclic Immunofluorescence
(CycIF), which allow for the analysis of over 30 biomarkers on a single tissue
section, are essential tools for scientists to investigate the subcellular
complexities of cancer \[1\]. Indeed, CyCIF has been instrumental in revealing
immune-tumor interactions and the progression of melanoma at single-cell
precision \[2\]. More recently, researchers have extended these techniques to
image volumes, allowing for an even more comprehensive analysis of the diverse
_cell types_ and _states_ within the tumor microenvironment and their _spatial
interactions_ \[3\]. However, effective visualization and investigation of
these volumes is difficult, given their size and dimensionality. Scientists now
seek new methods that can address the challenges of data occlusion and improve
the process of exploring and discovering these hard-to-see interactions. The
first step towards this—and the focus of this BioMedVis Challenge—is to develop
algorithms that optimize camera views of Regions of Interest (ROIs) that feature
important subsets of biomarkers.

### Challenge Task

The starting Jupyter Notebook presents one ROI with _4 channels of interest_ in
the dataset and a second ROI with _6 channels of interest_. It is your task to
find the best possible camera view configurations for a given ROI that 1) shows
maximum spatial interaction of selected channels and 2) minimizes data
occlusion. You can start with the first two _areas_ given as X, Y, Z
coordinates.

The following settings must be defined for each view configuration:

-   Camera:
    -   Zoom Level
-   Volume Settings:
    -   Translation (X, Y, Z)
    -   Rotation (X, Y, Z)
-   Channels:
    -   Selection, Color, and Value Range

As a more advanced alternative, you can also try to adapt the shader code given
in Vitessce to allow for more elaborate rendering operations (e.g., adaptive
transparency to highlight structures of interest and reduce occlusion along the
view ray).

#### Optimization Criteria:

You should optimize your algorithm for finding potential view
configurations by having the following criteria in mind:

-   Find the best possible view for the target structure of interest
    with minimal occlusion
-   You should activate at least two channels (but you can activate as
    many as you see fit)
-   For one target you can find multiple views
    -   Find the best sequence of views to show the regions of interest
        (ROIs) in the best possible way

Additionally, you can also:

-   Find a way to navigate between the view configurations using
    animation
-   Find a creative solution to make the ROIs visible while maintaining
    the context of the volume

### Data and Documentation

The data volume included in this challenge represents a 194x5508x10908
volume of cancerous tissue belonging to a patient suffering from
metastatic melanoma. Scientists have identified "immune niches" in this
tissue, which contain specific interactions between immune cells of
different types and states. Included in the data:

-   70 channels
-   2 ROI's as examples in Jupyter

Also provided is a Jupyter Notebook (link/details), which includes all
necessary starting code and information:
